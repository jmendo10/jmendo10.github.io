        <h3><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Good Website Layout</a></h3>
        <p>Spotify is a music streaming service used all around the world.</p>
        <h3><a href="http://thebiguglywebsite.com/">Bad website Layout</a></h3>
        <p>The Big ugly Website is just what it says in the name as a unorganized unappealing mess.</p>
      </section>

    <ol>
      <li>C:Contrast - Contrast varies from spotify to the big ugly. One draws attention to important points and the other doesnt complement well.</li>
      <li>R:Repetition - Spotify uses similar patterns while the other is sparatic and doesnt carry over.</li>
      <li>A:Alignment - The good website Spotify has important links organized using the left-to-right principle for better reading.<br> The bad website while not the worst still has some errors with this and moves up and down making it that much harder to follow.  </li>
      <li>P:Proximity - Rival prices to our competitors!</li>
    </ol>
